Set up API Keys (Optional, for full functionality):

The current version uses mock API functions for demonstration. For real AI capabilities, you would integrate with an actual image captioning, translation, and analysis API (e.g., Google Cloud Vision AI, Google Translate API, or a custom model).

For the AI Chat Assistant: The AIChatAssistant.js component is set up to use the Google Gemini API. You will need to obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console and configure it within the AIChatAssistant.js file where const apiKey = ""; is defined.

Note: In the Canvas environment, the apiKey is automatically provided at runtime if left as "". For local development, you might need to manually insert your key or use environment variables.
